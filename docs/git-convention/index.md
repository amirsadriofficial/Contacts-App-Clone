## Commits Conventions:

for the commits we should follow the convention that it covers id of your task related to this commit in the tasks board, times that you worked on this commit, and phase of this commit.

<br/>

pattern:

```
type of your task: your message description
```

for type of tasks we have:

- feat: for adding new feature to the project
- fix: for debugging and fix bugs
- ref: refactor some of codes
- test: for adding tests
- doc: for adding documentation

<br/>

For example:

```
git commit -m "doc: add commit conventions to the readme file"
```
